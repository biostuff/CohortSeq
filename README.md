install requirements (besides 'pip'):

We advice the use of virtualenv to allow multiples environments, who already comes with a pip per environment.. 
	pip install virtualenv

After cloning, change into the root of the project directory and run
        virtualenv env
	source env/bin/activate

The dependenciess are defined at the requirements.txt file, that you can simply load with
	pip install -r requirements.txt
